<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>
  <p>Quantum annealing is a computational paradigm to search for the minimum
  of a cost function (multivariable function to be minimized) through a control
  of quantum fluctuations. Quantum annealing is used mainly for combinatorial
  optimization problems with discrete variables. Many practically important
  problems can be formulated as combinatorial optimization, typically machine
  learning for pattern recognition, natural language processing, medical
  diagnosis, etc. Finding efficient methods to solve combinatorial optimization
  problems is therefore very important, and this is one of the reasons why
  quantum annealing attracts much attention.</p>
  <p>To perform quantum annealing, one writes the cost function in terms of
  the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model">Ising model </a>of statistical mechanics. The Hamiltonian (energy function) of the Ising
  model should be chosen such that its lowest-energy state (ground state)
  represents the solution to the combinatorial optimization problem. A term
  representing quantum-mechanical fluctuations is then added to the Hamiltonian
  to induce quantum transitions between the states.</p>
  <p>One first chooses a very large coefficient for the quantum term, which
  leads to to a uniform probability of the existence of states over all states
  as in the left panel (blue line) of the figure. This is a trivial state
  and can be realized easily. Then one gradually decreases the value of the
  coefficient of the quantum term. The state of the system follows the time-dependent
  Schrödinger equation, the natural time evolution of a physical system.
  The coefficient of the quantum term finally reaches zero, and only the
  classical term of the Hamiltonian, the Ising model whose ground state is
  to be identified, remains at the end of the process. It is then expected
  that the probability has by far the largest value for the solution (the
  right-most panel of the figure) to the combinatorial optimization problem
  at the end of the annealing process.</p>

<p align="center" style="font-size : large;background-color : #FFE2B2;text-align : center;">Formulation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hamiltonian of the Ising model with transverse field (transverse-field
Ising model) is written as follows,</p>
<img src="./Quantum Annealing_ Quantum computing for combinatorial optimization problems_files/eq1.jpg" width="240" height="37" border="0"><br>
<p>where <i>σ</i> is the Pauli matrix. The first term on the right side is the (classical)
Ising model. The second term, the transverse-field term, causes quantum
fluctuations between classical states. The coefficient <i>Γ</i>(<i>t</i>) starts with a very large value and decreases toward zero at the end of
the annealing process, following the natural time evolution of the Schrödinger
equation.</p>
<p><u><font size="+1">Historical note</font></u><br>
This prescription of quantum annealing as widely used now was first proposed
in 1998 [1], where the method was shown to be very effective for several
combinatorial optimization problems. An experiment for a magnetic system
soon followed [2] as well as large-scale numerical studies for complex
systems [3]. Notice that Kadowaki had already done in his Thesis [4] something
similar to [3]. Also, a continuous-space formulation, different from the
Ising-model formulation for combinatorial optimization, had appeared in
[5]. A paper published in 2001 [6] reformulated quantum annealing to use
the following Hamiltonian, under which the system evolution terminates
after a finite time <i>T</i> ,</p>
<img src="./Quantum Annealing_ Quantum computing for combinatorial optimization problems_files/eq2.jpg" width="258" height="47" border="0">
<p>It was proposed in [6] to use the term "quantum adiabatic evolution"
because the system is supposed to follow the ground state adiabatically,
in the sense of quantum mechanics, from the initial state to the final
state. </p>

<p>Quantum annealing is sometimes understood as a "noisy version"
of quantum adiabatic computation in the sense that the former allows for
environmental noise in contrast to the latter. A careful scrutiny of the
above-listed papers reveals that these two ideas are essentially the same,
at least in their initially-proposed formulations. Nevertheless, they differ
in several aspects including the strict imposition of adiabaticity in quantum
adiabatic computation. Quantum annealing, in contrast, allows for a non-adiabatic
time evolution with the expectation that the system reaches the target
state with a non-vanishing probability even without the adiabatic condition.
Notice that noise is not intrinsic in quantum annealing, although it is
not excluded. Also, references [2,3,6] all cite [1] as their predecessors.
The origin of current high activities in this field is attributed to [1].</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Quantum annealing is a type of quantum computation because it uses quantum
effects in the process to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Let
us compare quantum annealing with a few related methods.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Simulated annealing</p>
  <p>Simulated annealing is a generic method to solve optimization problems
  using classical probability, or thermal effects in analogy with statistical
  mechanics, and is used widely in practical applications. It has been shown
  that quantum annealing, in theory, allows the system to approach the correct
  solution more quickly than simulated annealing if we control the coefficient
  of the transverse field <i>Γ</i>(<i>t</i>) as a function of time<i> t</i> in the same manner as the temperature <i>T</i>(<i>t</i>) in simulated time [7]. Quantum annealing can be simulated on a conventional
  computer using quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Dedicated quantum devices
  have the potential to perform quantum annealing much more efficiently and
  are tested extensively.</p>

  </li><li>
  <p>Circuit model</p>
  <p>Many of the studies of quantum computation concern the circuit (gate) model,
  in which one applies quantum gates one by one to the state of a system
  toward the desired solution of the problem. A large number of research
  papers have been published, but experiments have been seriously plagued
  by decoherence, i.e., destruction of quantum states through interactions
  with the environment. It seems still very long before a device of real-life
  usefulness is built. Also, the application of the circuit-model quantum
  computer is very limited: e.g., integer factoring, simulations of quantum
  systems, and solving linear equations show essential speedup by circuit-model
  quantum computation. For other problems, circuit-model quantum computers
  are not fast.　In other words, a circuit-model quantum computer, if ever
  realized, is an extremely special-purpose machine. </p>
  <p>A realistic application of circuit model quantum computers is quantum simulation
  of small-size molecules [8], the commercial value of which is not necessarily
  clear at this moment. As for the number factoring and Shor's algorithm,
  it is important to keep in mind that research efforts to jeopardize widely-used
  RSA cryptography should take into account legal and moral aspects. Also,
  methods to efficiently solve linear equations by circuit model quantum
  computers may be applied to machine learning and related tasks [9,10].</p>

  <p>In contrast, a quantum annealing machine can be used for combinatorial
  optimization, which has a wide range of practical applications. Also, integer-factoring
  algorithms for quantum annealing have been developed [11], but there is
  no guarantee that these algorithms are exponentially fast. It is known
  that quantum annealing, in its quantum adiabatic formulation, is theoretically
  equivalent to the gate model [12].</p>

  <p>Quantum annealing is less prone to decoherence than the circuit model since
  the former follows the inherently-stable ground state or low excited states.
  It is also an advantage of quantum annealing that one does not have to
  specify the time evolution explicitly: In quantum annealing, the system
  evolves literally naturally following the Schrödinger equation. </p>

  classical computers for specific purposes as well as the time span before

  </li><li>
  <p>Classical (conventional) computer</p>
  <p>The goal of quantum annealing is to solve optimization problems. Quantum
  annealing machines are not to replace conventional computers that are useful
  for any purposes (universal computation). This fact is shared by the circuit
  model. One should not misunderstand that conventional computers will eventually
  be replaced by ultra-fast quantum computers in our daily applications.<br>
  <br>
  As long as optimization problems are concerned, there exists some evidence
  that quantum annealing outperforms simulated annealing carried out on classical
  computers. It is nevertheless unclear whether or not there exist problems
  of wide practical impact where quantum annealing achieves overwhelming
  (exponential) speedup over conventional methods. Notice that there indeed
  exist a <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.050501">problem</a> in which an exponential speedup by quantum annealing (not by adiabatic
  quantum computation) is proved although this problem is of limited practical
  usefulness.</p> 
</li></ul>

  <p>Computational complexity and related topics</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Quantum annealing needs an exponentially long time to find the exact solution
    to the most difficult problems among all QUBO's (Ising models).</p> 
    </li><li>
    <p>Indeed, it is explicitly shown from the analysis of energy spectra that
    quantum annealing spends an exponentially long time to solve several specific
    problems </p>
    </li><li>
    <p>It has nevertheless been well known from a number of numerical and analytical
    studies that quantum annealing improves the performance, if not exponentially,
    of solving many combinatorial optimization problems in comparison with
    classical simulated annealing. </p>
    </li><li>
    <p>It is not expected that quantum annealing would drastically speedup the
    time to reach solutions to many problems for which only exponentially slow
    classical algorithms are known. It is also incorrect, on the other hand,
    that there would exist no such cases. Indeed this <a href="http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.050501">paper</a> shows that an exponential speedup is reached for the binary-tree problem.
    A small downside of this result is that the problem is academic and it
    is not clear how (and if) this result may have a social impact.</p> 
    </li><li>
    <p>One of the important advantages of quantum annealing over the circuit model
    is that quantum annealing does not need an explicit construction of step-by-step
    instructions (algorithm) to run the process.</p> 
    </li><li>
    <p>It is not necessary for quantum annealing to trace the instantaneous ground
    state. <img src="./Quantum Annealing_ Quantum computing for combinatorial optimization problems_files/QA-AQC.jpg" width="229" height="126" border="0" align="right">Evaluation of computational complexity based on the energy-gap analysis
    reveals only part of the possibilities of quantum annealing. Indeed, the
    above-mentioned solution to the binary-tree problem does not follow the
    instantaneous ground state. In other words, adiabatic quantum computation
    (AQC) is a subset of quantum annealing (QA) but the converse is not true.
    Also, quantum annealing may be understood to allow for interactions with
    the environment including temperature effects.</p>

seem to indicate that quantum annealing is indeed realized in the machine.
Further developments are worth careful attention.</p>
<p>IARPA is going to run a program <a href="http://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/qeo">QEO (Quantum-Enhanced Optimization)</a>. The goal is to build a prototype quantum annealer of about 100 qubits
with high-performance superconducting qubits and with more complex connectivity
between qubits.</p>
